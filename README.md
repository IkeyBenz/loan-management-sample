Build a Loan Management Application
Objective:
Create a full-stack Next.js application that allows lenders to create, view, and manage loans.
This project will help you demonstrate your proficiency in React, Next.js, T ailwind CSS,
shadcn/ui components, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. It will also showcase your ability to design a
polished user experience. We encourage the use of AI tools to enhance your development
productivity.
Project Requirements
Front-end:
● Framework:
○ Use React with Next.js.
○ Implement Next.js Server Actions for server-side functionality.

○ Ensure accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG guidelines).
● Data Handling:
○ Fetch data using Next.js data fetching methods.
○ Manage state effectively
Back-end:
● API Routes:
○ Use Next.js Server Actions to handle server-side functionality.

freedom in the app's functionality and design.
● Feel free to add features that you think would enhance the application or demonstrate
your skills.
Use of AI Tools:
● AI Assistance Encouraged: We encourage the use of AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot,
ChatGPT) to enhance your development productivity.
AI Functionality (Bonus):
● AI Features: Feel free to pull in a api for accessing LLM’s and add or enhance any
feature you’d like
Testing (Bonus):
● Unit or Integration Tests:
○ Write unit tests or integration tests for critical components and functions.
